This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version. The error can lead to unpredictable results, including program crashes or incorrect data manipulation.  Understanding array bounds is crucial for writing robust Perl code.
